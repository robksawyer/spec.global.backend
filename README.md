> Spec (http://spec.global) is filling a niche in the [display advertising technology landscape](http://prezi.com/katuvp2rkyk_/the-display-advertising-technology-landscape/) by providing media planning and creative agencies a platform that connects them to site and publisher inventory specifications.

## Used components and development tools
The Spec backend application uses following 3rd party libraries to make all this magic happen. To see all of the components used, check the `package.json` file in the root directory.

### Components 

* sails-postgresql (https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-postgresql)
* sails-generate-auth (https://www.npmjs.org/package/sails-generate-auth)
* PassportJS (http://passportjs.org/)

### Development Tools
* GulpJS (http://www.gulpjs.com)
* SailsJS (http://sailsjs.org) - `npm install -g sails`
* Karma (https://github.com/karma-runner/karma) - Unit test runner
* Protractor (http://angular.github.io/protractor) - End to end (E2E) test runner
* PhantomJS (http://phantomjs.org) - Headless WebKit scriptable with a JavaScript API
* Homebrew (http://brew.sh)
* Git (http://git-scm.com)
* Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
* NPM (http://nodejs.org)

Note that this list may change at any time and may not be complete.


# Run the app

If you just want to see the app in action run the following:

1. `npm install`
2. `gulp production`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:1337` in your browser.
4. Start up [spec.global.frontend](https://github.com/robksawyer/spec.global.frontend).

# Before you dive in

In order to get a better understanding of how Sails config variables are passed around. Check out this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18267706/create-config-variables-in-sails-js). You should also check out the document [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) as it has on-boarding information.

# Technology Stack

## Frontend

Information about the apps frontend can be found in [spec.global.frontend/README.md](https://github.com/robksawyer/spec.global.frontend/blob/master/README.md).


## Backend

Spec is built on the [SailsJS](http://sailsjs.org) framework. Data storage is provided by [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/). The app has also been configured for testing with [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) via Grunt.

- [LoDash](http://devdocs.io/lodash/) - SailsJS is built on this, so it's imperative that you atleast know a little about it.
- [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) - Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on node.js and the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
- [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) - Headless browser testing.


## Development

For development and task management, we're using [Gulp](http://www.gulpjs.com) and the Node Package Manager (NPM). In order to install dependencies you must run `npm install` in the app directoy. If you don't have npm, that means you don't have NodeJS installed. Check out [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) â€“ it'll help you get the programs you need quickly.

```bash
gulp serve
```

Then head to `http://localhost:3001` in your browser.

The `serve` tasks starts a static file server, which serves the AngularJS application, and a watch task which watches
all files for changes and lints, builds and injects them into the index.html accordingly.

## Production ready build - a.k.a. dist

To make the app ready for deploy to production run:

```bash
gulp dist
```

Now there's a `./dist` folder with all scripts and stylesheets concatenated and minified, also third party libraries
installed with bower will be concatenated and minified into `vendors.min.js` and `vendors.min.css` respectively.

To run your deployment code run:

```bash
gulp production
```

Then head to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

# Testing

To run tests run:

```bash
gulp test
```

**Or** first inject all test files into `karma.conf.js` with:

```bash
gulp karma-conf
```

Then you're able to run Karma directly. Example:

```bash
karma start --single-run
```

# The App
The current app is running at <http://spec-global-backend.herokuapp.com>.

# Staging 

Coming soon...
~~The current staging site is located at <http://spec-global-backend-stage.herokuapp.com>.~~


# Deployment 

## Environment Variables

These can be tricky if you've never worked with them. Basically, our strategy is similar to what's mentioned in the post <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21291111/sails-js-accessing-local-js-environment-settings-in-controllers>. The idea here is to add environment variables needed locally by Sails to the `config/local.js` file. All of the others are added using `heroku config:set MYVAR=''` and then used in the production code via `process.env.MYVAR`.

## General Info

There are a couple of things to note about deployment. First, check the `package.json` file to ensure that the scripts section is set to your liking. In order to start the production version of Sails, you'd want something like the following.

```
...
"scripts": {
    "start": "sails lift --prod",
    "debug": "node debug app.js"
 },
 ...
 ```

`git push heroku master`
